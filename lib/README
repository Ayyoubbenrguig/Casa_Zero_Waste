# Project Libraries Directory

This directory contains project-specific (private) libraries that PlatformIO will compile into static libraries and link into the executable file. Each library should be placed in its own separate directory within the `lib` folder.

## Directory Structure

Organize your libraries in the following structure:

```
|-- lib
|   |-- Bar
|   |   |-- docs            # Documentation for the Bar library
|   |   |-- examples        # Example usage of the Bar library
|   |   |-- src             # Source files for the Bar library
|   |       |- Bar.c
|   |       |- Bar.h
|   |   |- library.json     # Optional, custom build options for Bar library (see PlatformIO documentation)
|   |
|   |-- Foo
|   |   |- Foo.c            # Source file for the Foo library
|   |   |- Foo.h
|   |
|   |- README.md            # This README file
|
|-- platformio.ini          # PlatformIO configuration file
|-- src
    |- main.c               # Main source file of the project
```

### Example Code in `src/main.c`

The main source file can include the libraries like so:

```c
#include <Foo.h>
#include <Bar.h>

int main (void)
{
    // Your code here
}
```

## PlatformIO Library Dependency Finder

PlatformIO's Library Dependency Finder (LDF) will automatically scan the project source files to find and include the necessary libraries. This feature simplifies library management, so you don’t need to manually specify library dependencies.

For more information on the PlatformIO Library Dependency Finder, refer to the official documentation:
- [PlatformIO Library Dependency Finder](https://docs.platformio.org/page/librarymanager/ldf.html)

## Additional Resources

If you need custom build options or other configurations for your libraries, you can add a `library.json` file in each library’s directory. Learn more about custom build options here:
